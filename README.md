# SASS

#CSS

This is a space dedicated to practicing and consolidating my knowledge of Sass, the powerful CSS preprocessor.

Here you'll find a series of examples and solutions I've developed following tutorials and resources, covering everything from the basics to advanced Sass features. This repository is ideal for anyone learning or looking to review how Sass can improve and streamline stylesheet development.

### About This Repository:
This repository contains a collection of .scss files (and their corresponding compiled .css files) that demonstrate various Sass features, including:

- Variables: How to define and use variables for colors, fonts, spacing, etc.
- Nesting: Organize CSS selectors in a more readable and structured way.
- Mixins: Create reusable CSS code blocks for common properties.
- Extend/Inheritance: Efficiently share CSS properties between selectors.
- Functions: Create reusable logic to generate CSS values.
- Operators: Perform mathematical calculations on CSS values.
- Partials and Import: Modularize your Sass code into smaller, more manageable files.
- Project Structure: Recommended organization for Sass projects.
- Maps: Store key-value pairs for complex configurations.
- Flow Control (@if, @else, @for, @each, @while): Add conditional logic and loops to your CSS.
